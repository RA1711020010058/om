            <p>Online gaming is hugely popular with children and young people. Annual research conducted by OFCOM shows that gaming is still one of the top activities enjoyed by 10-25 year olds online, with many of them gaming via mobile devices and computers and going online using their games consoles such as ps5 and xbox. From sport related games to mission based games and quests inspiring users to complete challenges,
            interactive games cater for a wide range of interests,
            and can enable users to link up and play together.
            Most games now have an online element to them.
